We came up with an idea, did our research and planning, brought our pseudo code into real code. Then, we created our components, graphs with subgraphs, and tested with fbp-spec, noflo-tester, and normal mocha tests. We created the required files for testing with travis, and our package json for publishing and pulling in requirements. We pulled in components from noflo/math, and created an index to run it in production with the option to debug. A library is used to help process our words and determine the emotion and score of a sentence.
