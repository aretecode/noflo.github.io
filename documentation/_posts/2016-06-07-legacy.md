## <a name="wirepattern-vs-process"></a> WirePattern vs process

### Firing
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| when all of the `inPorts` defined in the `in` WirePattern parameters and the `required` `param` ports have data, it is triggered. | It is fired every time new data comes into any of the ports, you decide whether it matches the preconditions |

### State
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| to keep state, either properties are set on the component, or params are used depending on the situation. | data can be kept in the buffer by using the buffer helper methods and removing it when done. |


### Request Isolation
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| difficult, see https://github.com/noflo/noflo/blob/master/src/lib/Helpers.coffee#L63
https://github.com/noflo/noflo/blob/master/spec/Helpers.coffee#L1460 | request isolation for free with packet `scope` |


### Accessing ports
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| anywhere that has access to the component, use `component.outPorts.portname` or `component.inPorts.portname`. | inside process api function `output.ports.portname`, or `input.ports.portname`, or when [accessing input](/process-api/#getting) or when [sending](/process-api/#sending). |

<a name="async"></a>
## <a name="asynchronous-components"></a>Asynchronous components
Asynchronous components process data and send output some time later. The outputs are sent in the order that they are processed, which might be a different than the order received.

Previously, we used a dedicated class named `AsyncComponent` which would be extended.

Now, [process api](/documentation/process-api) is asynchronous by default.

WirePattern can be used for async by setting the `async` property. [WirePattern Async](/documentation/legacy/#async)


## <a name="wirepattern">WirePattern</a>


{% highlight coffeescript %}
exports.getComponent = ->
c = new noflo.Component
# when you are finished processing, call `done`
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c, (data, groups, out, done) ->
    done()
{% endhighlight %}



### 1) in & out array

``` coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # When `in` has an array, it will put them all into an object as the object properties
  # When `out` has an array, it will make the out an object and put each output as the objects properties
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['in', 'eh'] # the inPorts to recieve from
    out: ['out', 'canada'] # the outPorts to send out of
    async: true # whether the component is asynchronous or not
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.out.send data.out
    out.canada.send data.eh
    done()
```

### 2) in & out singular

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # When `in` only has one string, it is only the data sent to it
  # When `out` is only one string, is is only the port to send out of
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: 'eh'
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
  , (eh, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```
### 3) forwardGroups

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # `forwardGroups` is similar to using forwardBrackets in process api, it takes groups from each `in` sent to it and sends them to each `out` wrapping them.
  # it would forward group IPs from
  # inputs to the output sending them along with the data. This option also
  # accepts string or array values, if you want to forward groups from specific
  # port(s) only. By default group forwarding is `false`.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 4) group

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # `group` will ensure that WirePattern will only fire when each `in` has received data wrapped in the same group (ie, `eh` receives the same groups as `moose`)
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 5) ordered

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # using `ordered` will make sure the data that is received in the order you defined it in the `in`, in this case, `eh` before `moose`

  # With `config.group = true` it checks incoming group IPs and collates
  # data with matching group IPs. By default this kind of grouping is `false`.
  # Set `config.group` to a RegExp object to correlate inputs only if the
  # group matches the expression (e.g. `^req_`). For non-matching groups
  # the component will act normally.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
    ordered: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 6) params

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # using `params` will keep whatever the last data that was sent to it under `c.params.name`. For example here, `c.params.igloo`. Important to note it will not wait for params before firing.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    params: ['igloo']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
    ordered: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    console.log c.params.igloo
    out.send eh
    done()
```

`dropInput` makes all input that comes before receiving `required` params.


<div class="note">
if you do not specify an <pre>in</pre> port it will use the inPort named <pre>in</pre> by default if it exists, the same for <pre>out</pre>
</div>

<a id="port-events"></a>
### Ports and events

Being a flow-based programming environment, the main action in NoFlo happens through ports and their connections. All actions a component does should be triggered via input port events. There are several events that can be associated with ports:

* _Attach_: there is a connection to the port
* _Connect_: the port has started sending or receiving a data transmission
* _BeginGroup_: the data stream after this event is associated with a given named group. Components may or may not utilize this information
* _Data_: an individual data packet in a transmission. There might be multiple depending on how a component operates
* _EndGroup_: A particular grouped stream of data ends
* _Disconnect_: end of data transmission
* _Detach_: A connection to the port has been removed
* _IP_: An Information Packet has been sent, could be with a type of `data`, `openBracket`, or `closeBracket`. This is the modern way, and usually the only thing that should be listened for.

It depends on the nature of the component how these events may be handled. Most typical components do operations on a whole transmission, meaning that they should wait for the _disconnect_ event on inports before they act, but some components can also act on single _data_ packets coming in.

When a port has no connections, meaning that it was initialized without a connection, or a _detach_ event has happened, it should do no operations regarding that port.


## <a name="Translation"></a>Translation


In process api, there are no `connect` and `disconnect` events inside of the `process` function. However, for backwards compatibility, they are translated when sending out.

### Old to new
* _Connect_: is translated into _OpenBracket_
* _BeginGroup_: is translated into _OpenBracket_
* _EndGroup_: is translated into _CloseBracket_
* _Disconnect_: is translated into _CloseBracket_

### New to old
* _OpenBracket_ (aside from the outtermost): are translated into _BeginGroup_
* _CloseBracket_ (aside from the outtermost): are translated into _EndGroup_

This means if you send out events using the new API, you can use the old way of listening to it, and vice versa.
